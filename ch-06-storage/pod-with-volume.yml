# Creating a webserver pod that will use host hard disk 
# to store its data. Data will be persistent and independent
# to the lifecycle of the pod. 
#
# The volume will be automaticatally created on the host
# where the pod is assigned by the scheduler.
#
# This pod definition also has memory and cpu limits
#
# create namespace prod -
# kubectl create namespace prod
#
# run the pod
# kubectl create -f pod-with-volume.yml
#
# check the pod
# kubectl get pods --namespace=prod
#
# get details about pod
# kubectl describe pod/sanjaya-app --namespace=prod
# {observe the mount location and node where its deployed}
#
# ssh onto the node where its deployed and go inside the pod
# kubectl exec -it nnappone /bin/bash --namespace=prod
#
# { go inside /var/www/html/ directory and create a file }
#
# exit from the pod and delete the pod
#
# delete pod
# kubectl delete pod/sanjaya-app --namespace=prod
# 
# now again go inside the same node where the pod was running
# you will still find the file created inside /tmp/webserver/
# directory
#
